# 🕯️ Memory Lane

*A quiet place to remember, reflect, and heal.*

Memory Lane is a **terminal-based Python application** designed to preserve memories, milestones, emotions, and unsent words connected to someone you once loved.  
It’s not about moving on fast — it’s about **processing honestly**.

> Sometimes you don’t need closure.  
> Sometimes you just need a place to put the memories. 🌙
