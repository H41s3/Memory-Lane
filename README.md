# 🕯️ Memory Lane

*A quiet place to remember, reflect, and heal.*

Memory Lane is a **terminal-based Python application** designed to
preserve memories, milestones, emotions, and unsent words connected to
someone you once loved.\
It's not about moving on fast --- it's about **processing honestly**.

> Sometimes you don't need closure.\
> Sometimes you just need a place to put the memories. 🌙

## ✨ Features

🧠 **Memory Keeper** -- Store cherished memories with timestamps and
optional media links\
🏁 **Relationship Milestones** -- Record important moments that shaped
the relationship\
📅 **Special Dates Reminder** -- Save meaningful dates and receive
reminders when they arrive\
🎭 **Mood Simulation** -- Set your mood and receive reflective
responses\
🎶 **Quotes & Songs Archive** -- Keep the lines, lyrics, or words that
still hit home\
✉️ **Unsent Letters** -- Write letters you'll never send, but needed to

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   No external libraries required

### Run the App

``` bash
python reminisce.py
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧭 How It Works

When you run the program, you'll see a menu like this:

    === Menu ===
    1. Introduce Person
    2. Know More About Her
    3. Add Memory
    4. List Memories
    ...
    19. Exit

Enter the number of the action you want and follow the prompts.\
Everything is automatically saved to `data.json`.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

-   **Relapse Class** -- Represents an emotional archive tied to one
    person\
-   **JSON Storage** -- Human-readable, easy to back up\
-   **Time-stamped Entries** -- Every memory is saved with context

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Use Cases

-   Journaling after a breakup 💔\
-   Preserving meaningful memories\
-   Emotional self-reflection through code\
-   A creative and personal Python project

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ Notes

-   `data.json` is created automatically if it doesn't exist\
-   Deleted entries are permanent

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌱 Future Improvements

-   🔐 Encrypted memory storage\
-   📊 Timeline visualization\
-   🖥️ GUI version\
-   ☁️ Cloud backup

## 🫂 Final Thought

This isn't just a Python project.\
It's a **digital memory box**.

If you're reading this while missing someone --- you're not weak.\
You're human. 🤍
