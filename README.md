# Memory-Lane

Memory-Lane is a project to help you capture, organize, and revisit personal memories, notes, and moments. This README provides a clear starting point — fill in or adjust sections below to match the project's actual architecture and requirements.

## Features
- Capture memories as text, images, or audio (placeholder — implement as needed)
- Organize memories with tags, dates, and locations
- Search and filter memories
- Private by default — user-authenticated access
- Export/import memory archives

## Tech stack (example)
- Frontend: React / Vue / Svelte (update as appropriate)
- Backend: Node.js (Express) / Python (Django / Flask) / Go (Gin) (update as appropriate)
- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite / MongoDB
- Storage: Local filesystem / S3-compatible object storage
- Authentication: JWT / OAuth / sessions

## Getting started
These steps assume a typical JS/Node setup. Replace with the repo's real instructions.

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/H41s3/Memory-Lane.git
   cd Memory-Lane

2. Install dependencies (example for Node.js):

   npm install

3. Create a .env file from the example and set required environment variables:

   cp .env.example .env
   # Then edit .env and fill values like DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, etc.

4. Run database migrations (if applicable):

   npm run migrate

5. Start the development server:

   npm run dev

6. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (adjust port as needed).

## Configuration
Add or update these values in your .env file (example keys):

- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/memory_lane
- NODE_ENV=development
- PORT=3000
- SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-secure-random-string
- STORAGE_PROVIDER=local

## Running tests
Describe how to run tests in the repository. Example:

   npm test

## Deployment
High-level notes for deployment — adapt to your platform (Heroku, Vercel, AWS, Docker):

- Build the frontend if applicable (npm run build)
- Apply database migrations
- Configure environment variables securely
- Configure object storage for media

## Folder structure (example)
- /client — frontend application
- /server — backend application
- /scripts — helper scripts
- /docs — documentation

Update this section to reflect the actual repository layout.
